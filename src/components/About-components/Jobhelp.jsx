                    <p>Applying for an Indian government job can be done online now. Documents may be scanned and submitted online. Unfortunately, an online application does not make the process any less stressful or cumbersome.</p>
                    <p>Applying to a government can be quite overwhelming with several deadlines and exam requirements. Rather than weeding through numerous websites, Sarkaari Pariksha lists all the government jobs. One-page summaries of the requirements provide all the important information in an easy-to-read format.</p>
