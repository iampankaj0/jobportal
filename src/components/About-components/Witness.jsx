                    <p>India has witnessed a high demand for Government jobs for many decades. People prefer Government jobs as their career option considering the wide variety of benefits that are associated with these. ‘Sarkari Naukri’ is a dream for millions of people across the nation, and only a few are lucky to land up with such jobs. People tend to take pride in having a Sarkari or Government job.</p>
                    <p> Government jobs hold the kind of authority not found in private jobs. These also offer job security for a lifetime, and hence a lot of youth prefer them. Getting into a Government job requires a person to go through multiple levels of tests. These include a written examination, interview and sometimes even physical examination. These are competitive exams, and millions of people appear for these exams to get into a coveted Government job.</p>
